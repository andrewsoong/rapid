        Please describe what you're using RAPID for. You can include such
        information as geographical domain, temporal range of your study, the
        type of river network you're using (NHDPlus, HydroSHEDS, other?), where
        your runoff data comes from (self-produced, obtained from NLDAS, GLDAS,
        or others), as well as what youâ€™re hoping to accomplish with RAPID.

      label: Why RAPID?
      description: >
        Please tell us why you chose RAPID. Perhaps because it is open source,
        is dockerized, uses mapped rivers as its computational elements, has
        parallel computing capabilities, has automated parameter estimation,
        etc.
      placeholder: This may give us ideas for what to keep supporting.

      description: >
        Do you use our Docker images?  Do you install RAPID yourself? If so,
        what operating system do you use? Are you on a local machine, a high
        performance computer, the compute cloud (which one)?
      placeholder: We like knowing these details to best support you.

      description: >
        RAPID has been open source since inception, and we have spend some time
        reflecting on what it took to build it and keep it open to all. The
        outcome of this reflection is
        [David et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015EA000142). 
        We don't expect you to read it all, but we ask that you please read just
        this one paragraph.

            I have read the last paragraph of Section 6.3 in
            [David et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015EA000142)

             "Finally, and contrary to common belief, open source software does
            not mean...")
