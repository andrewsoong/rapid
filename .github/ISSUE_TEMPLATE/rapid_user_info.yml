      description: > 
        Please describe what you're using RAPID for. You can include such
        information as geographical domain, type of river network you're using
        (NHDPlus, HydroSHEDS, other?), where your runoff data comes from
        (self-produced, obtained from NLDAS, GLDAS, or others), as well as what
        youâ€™re hoping to accomplish.

      label: Why RAPID?
      description: > 
        Please tell us why you chose RAPID. Perhaps because it is open source,
        is dockerized, uses mapped rivers as its computational elements, has 
        parallel computing capabilities, etc.
      placeholder: This may give us ideas for what to keep supporting.

      description: >
        RAPID has been open source since inception, and we have spend some time
        reflecting on what it took to build it and keep it open to all. The 
        outcome of this reflection is [David et al., 2016]
        (https://doi.org/10.1002/2015EA000142). We don't expect you to read it
        all, but we please ask that you read just one paragraph.

            I have read the last paragraph of Section 6.3 in
            [David et al., 2016]
            (https://doi.org/10.1002/2015EA000142) (the one starting with
             "Finally, and contrary to common belief, open source software does
            not mean...")
